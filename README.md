# 🌟 **SoftGo - Starter Kit built on Django Framework** 🌟  
*Kickstart your software or project development with prebuilt authentication and dashboard features!*  

### 🚀 **What is SoftGo?**  
SoftGo (Software + Django) is your go-to Django starter kit, designed to help developers—quickly set up the foundational elements of a project or software. With all essential features like login, signup, dynamic user dashboards, and remember-me functionality, you can skip the repetitive tasks and focus directly on building your actual use case. SoftGo takes care of the groundwork, allowing you to move fast and build smarter!

### ✨ **Key Features**  
- 🔐 **Authentication Done Right**: Seamless user registration, login, and logout functionalities, complete with password and email validation.
- 🛠 **Dynamic Dashboard**: Once logged in, users see a general dashboard with their profile and details dynamically populated from signup data.
- ⏳ **Persistent Login**: Users who click "Remember Me" stay logged in for **two weeks**, skipping the login process unless they manually log out.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Every page, including the login, registration, and dashboard pages, is fully responsive! 💻 📱
- 🚪 **Logout and Session Handling**: Easy user session management with built-in Django tools.

⚠️ **Note for Production**:  
If you're using **SoftGo** in production, **do not use the Tailwind CDN** (currently used for development). Instead, switch to the **Django-Tailwind package**. You can find the documentation [here](https://django-tailwind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
